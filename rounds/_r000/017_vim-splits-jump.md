This week I've published a Vim plugin for swiftly jumping between splits...


- `<C-h>` Jump towards left split

- `<C-j>` Jump towards lower split

- `<C-k>` Jump towards upper split

- `<C-l>` Jump towards right split


Check the [documentation][documentation__splits_jump] for detailed getting started and usage instructions, the [source code][source__splits_jump] is available on GitHub.
