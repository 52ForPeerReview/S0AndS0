This week I have published a JavaScript module for converting characters or strings to Hex Unicode, that functions for either NodeJS or web based projects.


Check the [documentation][documentation__to_unicode] for detailed getting started and usage instructions, the [source code][source__to_unicode] is available on GitHub, and a live [demo][demo__to_unicode] is hosted by GitHub Pages.
