This week I have published a Vim syntax and set of scripts that replace Emoji hex Unicode and word codes with symbols via `cchar`, eg...


```markdown

Check the [documentation][documentation__to_unicode] for detailed getting started and usage instructions, the [source code][source__to_unicode] is available on GitHub.
