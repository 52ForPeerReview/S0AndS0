This week I've published a Liquid module that builds list of links for sharing on social media sites.


Check the [documentation][documentation__includes_share_page] for detailed getting started and usage instructions, a [live demo][demo__includes_share_page] is hosted thanks to GitHub Pages, and the [source code][source__includes_share_page] is available on GitHub.
