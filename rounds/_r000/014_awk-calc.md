This week I've published a script for preforming floating point Math on the command-line via Awk script.


Check the [documentation][documentation__calc] for detailed getting started and usage instructions, the [source code][source__calc] is available on GitHub, and a live [demo][demo__calc] is hosted by GitHub Pages.


**Example Usage**


```Bash
calc.awk <<<'2 + 2'
#> 4
```
