This week I published a Liquid module that builds attribution list of links from page/post FrontMatter.


Check the [documentation][documentation__includes_attribution] for detailed getting started and usage instructions, a [live demo][demo__includes_attribution] is hosted thanks to GitHub Pages, and the [source code][source__includes_attribution] is available on GitHub.
